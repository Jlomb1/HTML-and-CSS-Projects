							Here is a good example of font text being colored green, this is actually pretty cool!

							Here is another example of font text being colored red!

							<h3>Here is a final example of using Hex code to give the font text 
							the color indigo, you could have also just written indigo in the font color, but instead
							it is written as #4B0082!</h3>

							Here is an example of changing not only the color, but the style of the font as well 
							as the actual size of the font!

							The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. 
							By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), 
							it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the 
							missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. 
					</font></p>
					<p><font color="purple" face="calibri" size="3">
							Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, 
							is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, 
							the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, 
							it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
