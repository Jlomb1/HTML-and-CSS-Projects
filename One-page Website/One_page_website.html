			<p>
				The Axolotl is a species that comes from Mexico, specifically Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco, both lakes<br>
				are no longer around. These small creatures are a mix between a lizard and a fish and have an extremely<br>
				important role in understanding cell-regeneration.<br>
				These little guys are unfortunately on the brink of extinction due to human city expansion. These animals<br>
				serve an important purpose in understanding stem-cell research. This is because an axolotl is one of the<br>
				one of few species to be able to regenerate almost any part of its body, even some parts of the brain!<br>
				Another fact about these creatures is that they retain juvenile characteristics into adulthood, meaning<br>
				they essentially stay in a "child like" state even as they get older<br>

					<h5>"Amphibians have porous skin and respond quickly to changes in the environment, the health of their populations can be an indicator of<br>
					the health of the environment. Axolotls are important in medical and scientific research because of their unique regenerative qualities as well<br> 
					as their neotenic characteristics."</h5>
