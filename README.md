# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

## This repository will contain some of the projects I will be working on utilizing HTML and CSS.

A lot of these projects are going to be examples, test projects, and even final programs that can be utilized as fully functioning software. I will keep this up to date with every project I go through!

# Here are the main projects for this repository:
