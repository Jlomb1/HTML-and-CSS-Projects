# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

## This repository will contain some of the projects I will be working on utilizing HTML and CSS.

A lot of these projects are going to be examples, test projects, and even final programs that can be utilized as fully functioning software. I will keep this up to date with every project I go through!

# Here are the main projects for this repository:

## - How to Start Lifting Weights
This was one of my first projects with just basic HTML, a small webpage including links, embeds, nav, etc. 

## - One Page Website
In this project we utilized CSS and HTML to create this single page about Axolotls.

## - Kyoto Runner Resort
This one of my first official websites after going through and learning many new things regarding CSS. This utilizes many new elements with CSS and HTML.

## - Academy Cinema
This project was structured mainly off of Bootstrap, this was to understand and utilize Bootstrap as a quick source for HTML with built in CSS.

## - My Finaly Project
With my final project I have created a webpage that is able to be accessed publicly, this was an over all final on utilizing CSS and HTML elements.

## Any remaining files were apart of learning, creating, editing, and attempting new project ideas and new concepts through HTML and CSS.
